Effect of Cytokines on differential gene expression in ER pos vs ER neg breast cancer

Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among women. Hereditary and environmental factors are known to predispose women to breast cancer. Genes and cytokines in the body are also known to play a role in the development or defense in the body against breast cancer. The growth of the tumor responds to stimulation or inhibition by these factors. We sought to investigate the differential expression of certain cytokines across estrogen receptor positive and estrogen receptor negative breast cancer subtypes and between normal and tumor tissue samples in women with breast cancer. Microarray and RNASeq analyses were used to quantify gene expression levels for genomic data on 1,098 tissue samples obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Data Portal (now absorbed into the Genomic Data Commons Project).  From these analyses, we are able to contribute to the current understanding of the biological factors that influence the development or treatment of breast cancer.           

Cytokines are any of a number of substances, such as interferon, interleukin, and growth factors, that are secreted by certain cells of the immune system and have an effect on other cells.
